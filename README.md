## Overview

### The project

This project was undertaken as part of the Refactory Catalyst Program CAT011

Karibu groceries LTD is a wholesale produce distributor dealing in cereals with 2 Branches in
different locations. Over time all operations have been recorded in ruled black books. This has
prompted the owner to seek for a software solution.

KGL deals in Beans, Grain Maize, Cow peas, G-nuts, Soybeans. It gets produce from: -

- Individual dealers with produce not less than a tone (1000kg)
- Other companies that are willing to sell to KGL
- And also gets from its own two farms in **Maganjo** and **Matugga**
- KGL has a **manager** and **2 attendants** in each of the branches
